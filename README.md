# Name Generator

Simple library to generate names for people. This library words by generating a human readable name by alternating between vowels and consenants.

## Example Usage

```csharp
string nameOne = Name.Create(5);
```
The number you pass into Create is a complexity indicator. The higher the number, the longer the name, although this does not equate to the actual length of the string as the names are generated in pairs of vowels and consenants.

Here are some example name that have been generated. Obviously they are not like common names like Dave, Geoff or Keith, but they are readable :-)
